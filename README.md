### Day00 ex00

##### Each of the datatypes are definied in decleration of the variable not by the define of the variable, set dose not have any particular order tuple is const variable list lift is a list and dict corresponds is similar as C++ map


### Day00 ex01


###### install comand for fancyer librarys python 3.10 -m pip install time
###### defult start time of time is 1970, 01, 01 or time 0 f can be used for form

### Day00 ex02

###### Command [in] is amazing example line:    elif printable in ["list", "tuple", "set", "dict"]:

###### printable[0].upper() + printable[1:] 
###### the [1:] would acces the rest of the elements of the array in this case

###### Importint your functions from other file happens like this [from NULL_not_found import NULL_not_found]


### Day00 ex03 the same thing as previous execerise

### Day00 ex04

Input comprehension from argv

### Day00 ex05 

2 diffrent types of input taking

### Day00 ex06 

Creates a new list of elements that corespond to the function data
Iteration trought the list of args, manipulation with this args with preselected functions lambda

### Day00 ex07

So not all data types you can opperate in similar manner, but is is super easy go from 1 data type to another in this case from the dict or map to the string
