# Notes

## Day00

### Day00 ex00

##### Each of the datatypes are definied in decleration of the variable not by the define of the variable, set dose not have any particular order tuple is const variable list lift is a list and dict corresponds is similar as C++ map


### Day00 ex01


###### install comand for fancyer librarys python 3.10 -m pip install time
###### defult start time of time is 1970, 01, 01 or time 0 f can be used for form

### Day00 ex02

###### Command [in] is amazing example line:    elif printable in ["list", "tuple", "set", "dict"]:

###### printable[0].upper() + printable[1:] 
###### the [1:] would acces the rest of the elements of the array in this case

###### Importint your functions from other file happens like this [from NULL_not_found import NULL_not_found]


### Day00 ex03 the same thing as previous execerise

### Day00 ex04

Input comprehension from argv

### Day00 ex05 

2 diffrent types of input taking

### Day00 ex06 

Creates a new list of elements that corespond to the function data
Iteration trought the list of args, manipulation with this args with preselected functions lambda

### Day00 ex07

So not all data types you can opperate in similar manner, but is is super easy go from 1 data type to another in this case from the dict or map to the string

### Day00 ex08

Recreated the ft_tqdm, static variables in context of C and yield return for updates


### Day00 ex09

Too Boring to Do


## Day01

### Day01 ex00

Modification of the data types and selection of specific data

### Day01 ex01

Removal of certain type of data from the data set

### Day01 ex02

Transfering image to a array of data

### Day01 ex03

Zooming in the image, croping image and resizing

### Day01 ex04

Rotation of the image

### Day01 ex05

Editing the color values of the image, we acces the array of the images and we modif the values in this array

[:, :, 0] = 0 this indicates if we want to select rows, colums or arrays


### Day02 ex00

Just an import function from the panda library
why panda is awesome, it is not complaing about the data set beeing wack, meanwhile np and list of list have diffrent problems, such as 
np complains about data set
list of list is hard to display on the grap

### Day02 ex01

Just a simple graph with plotting the data set

### Day02 ex02

Same excerise with more countries

### Day02 ex03

need to merge 2 datasets to find overlays and then to merge it

### Day03 ex00

Make the basic class with abstract value called Character
Make a class Startk inheriting from the character

### Day03 ex01 

Make Lannister class and Baratheon class that inherits from the Character

### Day03 ex02

2 approaches dirrectly call and constructor or call and super() that specifies that you should use the function from the base inheritence class

### Day03 ex03

Just a simple calculator

### Day03 ex04

Simple calculator with extra steps
